I am all about fluid, creative problem solving and personal learning rate that optimizes this factor, and nothing else. What matters is the speed of generating alternative ways of solving a problem. The ability that makes reaching a specific solution easier, faster and more effective.

My approach adopts a technology-agnostic perspective. What matters is the ease of minimizing time and space required to figure out a solution. Technology is like a growing field of ever-more potent puzzles to assemble solution pictures from.
